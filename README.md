## Things We Learned 📚
* `Building a fully functional web application including client-side and server-side from start to finish`
* `Versatility with sequelize, especially with a larger database`
* `Utilizing sequelize to pull from the entire database utilizing join tables and foreign keys`
* `Ease of use with Handlebars in easily serving data to the client-side, how it helps clean up routing`
* `How modular express can be, I.E creating clean and easily readable yet complicated server structures with express`
* `Most importantly: Metered. The metered api is extremely versatile, and can cut down code by thousands of lines just from their api, and their video chat api is genius. their docs are also super in depth and great for learning they taught me a heck of a lot of new stuff`
* `Working together as a group, utilizing our strengths to code the different parts of the site,troubleshooting as a team`
